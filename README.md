# Basic Operators

This section explains how to use basic operators in Python.

# Arithmetic Operators

- Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers

## number=1*8+6-2

## print(number)

- Try to predict what the answer will be. Does python follow order of operations?

- Another operator available is the modulo (%) operator, which returns the integer remainder of the division. dividend % divisor = remainder.

## test=11 % 3

## print(test)





# Classes and Objects

- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

- You can create multiple different objects that are of the same class(have the same variables and functions defined). However, each object contains independent copies of the variables defined in the class.

# init()

- The __init__() function, is a special function that is called when the class is being initiated. It's used for assigning values in a class.

# Dictionaries

- A dictionary is a data type similar to arrays, but works with keys and values instead of indexes. Each value stored in a dictionary can be accessed using a key, which is any type of object (a string, a number, a list, etc.) instead of using its index to address it.

- For example, a database of phone numbers could be stored using a dictionary

# Iterating over dictionaries

- Dictionaries can be iterated over, just like a list. However, a dictionary, unlike a list, does not keep the order of the values stored in it.





# Functions

# What are Functions?

- Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.

- Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".

- Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name

# How do you call functions in Python?

- Simply write the function's name followed by (), placing any required arguments within the brackets.

- Add a function named list_benefits() that returns the following list of strings: "More organized code", "More readable code", "Easier code reuse", "Allowing programmers to share and connect code together"

- Add a function named build_sentence(info) which receives a single argument containing a string and returns a sentence starting with the given string and ending with the string " is a benefit of functions!"


-For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions. The difference between range and xrange is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specified range, whereas xrange returns an iterator, which is more efficient. (Python 3 uses the range function, which acts like xrange). Note that the range function is zero based.

# Can we use "else" clause for loops?

- Unlike languages like C,CPP.. we can use else for loops. When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails then code part in "else" is executed. If a break statement is executed inside the for loop then the "else" part is skipped. Note that the "else" part is executed even if there is a continue statement.





# Printing

- Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).

- There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.

- For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.

## To print a string in Python 3, just write:

## print("Hello,World!")

- You can do anything else, not only "Hello,World!".




# String Formatting

- Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".

- Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)

## name="John" print("Hello, %s" % name)

## Here are some basic argument specifiers you should know:

## %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

## %d - Integers

## %f - Floating point numbers

## %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.

%x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)

 *String*

- Strings are bits of text. They can be defined as anything between quotes
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*Basic String Operations*

- Strings are bits of text. They can be defined as anything between quotes:

astring= "Hello"

astring2= "Hello"

Python Basics

What are the basics of python

Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various fields such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Here are some basics of Python:

Installation: Python can be downloaded and installed from the official Python website (python.org). It is available for different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Syntax: Python uses a clean and easy-to-understand syntax. It uses indentation (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define code blocks instead of braces or keywords. This indentation is crucial for the structure and readability of the code.

Data Types: Python supports various data types, including:

Integers (int): Whole numbers, e.g., 42

Floating-Point Numbers (float): Numbers with decimal points, e.g., 3.14

Strings (str): Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes, e.g., "Hello, World!"

Booleans (bool): Represents either True or False

Lists (list): Ordered collections of items enclosed in square brackets, e.g., [1, 2, 3]

Tuples (tuple): Similar to lists, but immutable (cannot be changed once created), e.g., (1, 2, 3)

Dictionaries (dict): Key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, e.g., {"name": "John", "age": 25}

Variables: Variables are used to store data in memory for later use. In Python, you can assign a value to a variable using the assignment operator (=). The data type of a variable is inferred automatically based on the assigned value.

Control Flow: Python provides various control flow structures:

Conditional statements: if, elif, and else are used for decision-making based on certain conditions.

Loops: for and while loops are used for iterating over a sequence of items or executing a block of code repeatedly.

Functions: Functions allow you to encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task. You can define your own functions using the def keyword. Functions can have parameters (inputs) and can return values.

Modules and Libraries: Python has a vast ecosystem of modules and libraries that extend its functionality. You can import these modules into your code using the import statement to leverage pre-built functions and classes. Examples include math for mathematical operations and random for random number generation.

Input and Output: Python allows you to interact with the user through the standard input (input()) and display output using the print() function.

These are just a few basics of Python to get you started. Python has extensive documentation and a supportive community, making it easy to find resources and examples for further learning.
  

  
  Let's create a basic "guess the number" game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.

Here's the step-by-step process:

Step 1: Import the necessary module.

import random

Step 2: Generate a random number.


number = random.randint(1, 100)

Step 3: Create a loop to allow the player to make guesses until they find the correct number.


while True:

    guess = int(input("Guess a number between 1 and 100: "))

    if guess == number:

        print("Congratulations! You guessed the correct number.")

        break

    elif guess < number:

        print("Too low. Try again.")

    else:

        print("Too high. Try again.")

Step 4: Run the game.

                        
if __name__ == '__main__':

    print("Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!")

    play_game()

That's it! You now have a simple "guess the number" game in Python. You can customize it further by adding additional features like keeping track of the number of attempts or implementing difficulty levels.
      
      
      
      
 Coding advanced algorithms and data structures requires a solid understanding of the underlying concepts and problem-solving techniques. Here's a general approach to coding advanced algorithms and data structures in Python:

1. Study and understand the algorithm or data structure: Start by thoroughly studying the algorithm or data structure you want to implement. Understand its purpose, how it works, and the problem it solves. Use textbooks, online resources, or academic papers to gain a deeper understanding.

2. Plan and design your implementation: Create a plan for how you'll implement the algorithm or data structure in Python. Break it down into smaller steps and think about the necessary data structures and operations involved. Consider the time and space complexities, as well as any specific requirements or constraints.

3. Choose the appropriate data structures: Depending on the algorithm or data structure, select the appropriate built-in data structures or design your own custom data structures using classes. For example, if you're implementing a graph, you may need to define classes for nodes and edges.

4. Implement the algorithm or data structure: Start translating your design into actual Python code. Write functions or methods that perform the necessary operations and utilize the chosen data structures. Pay attention to details, naming conventions, and code readability. Test your implementation incrementally to catch any errors or issues early on.

5. Optimize and analyze performance: Once you have a working implementation, analyze its performance in terms of time and space complexity. Look for opportunities to optimize the code by reducing unnecessary operations, improving memory usage, or utilizing more efficient algorithms or data structures. Use Python's profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and make necessary adjustments.

6. Test thoroughly: Test your implementation with a variety of inputs, including edge cases, to ensure its correctness and robustness. Write test cases that cover different scenarios and validate the expected outputs. Automated testing frameworks like `unittest` or `pytest` can be helpful for organizing and running tests.

7. Document and maintain: Document your code, including explanations of the algorithm or data structure, its implementation details, and any specific considerations. Add comments where necessary to improve code readability. Regularly review and update your codebase to ensure it remains maintainable and adaptable to potential changes or improvements.

Remember that advanced algorithms and data structures can be complex, and mastering them requires practice and continuous learning. Utilize resources like textbooks, online courses, programming challenges, and open-source projects to deepen your knowledge and gain practical experience.
      
      
Here are a few examples of advanced algorithms and data structures that you can consider implementing in Python:

Dijkstra's Algorithm: This algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

Depth-First Search (DFS): DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order.

Binary Search Tree (BST): A BST is a binary tree structure that maintains the property that the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.

AVL Tree: An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

Heap: A heap is a binary tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which allows efficient extraction of the maximum (or minimum) element.

Trie: A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is an efficient data structure for storing and searching strings based on their prefixes.

Kruskal's Algorithm: This algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph.

QuickSort: QuickSort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently sort elements.

Red-Black Tree: A red-black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that ensures the tree remains balanced and provides efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

These examples represent just a fraction of the possibilities, but they cover a range of different data structures and algorithms.
